# A Brief History of GRC
The use of technology in the realm of governance, risk management and compliance is relatively new. In fact, the GRC domain as an integrated sector is relatively a new concept. What is commonly known today as the GRC  domain was originally comprised of smaller silos (i.e. audit, risk, policy etc.). Over the past decade it became evident that these silos were much more connected than what was once thought and amalgamated to make a more inclusive and cohesive understanding of the GRC domain; therefore forming the umbrella domain of GRC. This amalgamation has allowed for business’ to have a more comprehensive scope of their organizational governance. What was once considered a secondary business function is now considered pivotal to the foundation and success of organizations.
With the rise of The Digital Age these areas which were traditionally time consuming and completed by pen and paper became consolidated and automated using technology. Today, governance, risk management and compliance platforms can integrate several areas of these sectors to provide comprehensive data to organizations. This information allows companies to have foundational data of their organizations and can be used to influence and drive change. Additionally, through the added understanding of the importance of how GRC effects organizations, the scope of the intended clientele has grown to all industries. 
Today, the GRC domain is using cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Together these technologies are able to predict risk, automate fraud detection, and harmonize all the information into one platform. As the GRC domain develops, it is important that companies in this field adapt and stay innovative.

# Galvanize History 
Galvanize is the result of an acquisition between ACL Services Limited and Rsam two former companies that used to specialize in audit command language and relational security assessment management, respectively. Prior to the acquisition, in 2017 Norwest Venture Partners, a venture capital and growth equity investment firm strategically funded Galvanize with $50 million dollars in its first round of funding.
 ACL, founded in 1987 by Hart and Harald Will acquired Rsam in February 2019. Together these companies released HighBond a GRC data integration platform that is comprised of different products responsible for unique sectors of a companies organizational governance. The acquisition was said to be a strategic move by both companies who were already established players in their field. The rebranding of ACL and Rsam to Galvanize was done to create industry consolidation and make Galvanize the top name in the governance, risk management and compliance sector. 
Specifically, Galvanize is best known for the HighBond platform. The HighBond platform is comprised of smaller GRC products that work together to present a holistic approach to a company’s governance. HighBond uses ACL robotics and Rsam technology to deliver a cloud-based, data driven and automation software. Audit Command Language (ACL), which was originally created to audit companies has adapted into ACL robotics and now contains analytics, robots (used for automation), results and storyboards. Rsam, on the other hand collects, integrates and operationalizes data. Together through Galvanize ACL robotics and Rsam pride themselves on being an easy-to-adopt, user friendly, low cost SaaS. 
# HighBond 
The HighBond platform has become an effective tool that brings together multiple aspects of security, risk management, compliances and audit executives. Through automation and connectivity HighBond has been able to reduce the need for repetitive manual tasks and offer real-time data analytics. Together these abilities have been able to save employees time allowing them to add value elsewhere in the organization, and provide companies with new new business insights though data.
Every year organizations face risks that cost them millions of dollars. In fact, “fraud costs organizations $2.1 trillion per year” according to a report done by Galvanize. This year due to the pandemic many organizations have gone virtual which has (not surprisingly) increased Cyberfraud. Galvanize revealed that ,“ 68% saw an increase in fraud activity at their organizations since the COVID-19 crisis began”.
Galvanize is using data analytics and machine learning to help address this issue. FraudBond, a specific feature of HighBond identifies fraud by consolidating data and detecting anomalies. In this instance the use of built-in visualization tools allow users to easily identify these anomalies. Specifically, FraudBond uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help identify trends and risk behaviours as well as “automate issue escalation and case management with workflow rules”. The use of robotics in FraudBond allows for the automation of regular audits. This works as a preventative measure and enables earlier fraud detection. This is especially important because the association of Certified Freud Examiners found, “that the typical fraud case goes 16 months without being detected”. 

# Competitors
There are many competitors that offer similar fraud detection services using analytics, including MetricStream and ServiceNow. While both MetricStream and ServiceNow are established players in the GRC field, Galvanize’s competitive advantage is their network of associations, their ease of use and implementation and the HighBond platform. While Galvanize’s competitors are able to offer similar services within the GRC spectrum, HighBond has a more extensive selection. Recently, both competitors revealed that they will be working with new technologies that will make them more competitive in the GRC domain. MetricStream is launching a new integrated platform and ServiceNow has recently purchased Element AI, a deep learning and leading artificial intelligence company to help them deliver smarter workflows and expand on their current AI capabilities. 
Not only does Galvanize offer a fully integrated SaaS platform but they have formed strategic alliances with technology companies and associations to offer an even more comprehensive approach to GRC. These alliances allow Galvanize to provide updated technologies, apply the best practices and have the best resources available to offer clients. Through their integrated platform, the use of data and their partner association, Galvanize has been able to impact each of their clients uniquely. Galvanize has been able to protect and strengthen organizations against risk, and provide data to influence and drive organizational change. From increasing efficiency through automation and streamlining workflows, to using data analytics to stop narcotic shipments, Galvanize allows organizations to be more informed and make more strategic decisions based on the insights they receive. 
Companies in this domain use risk reduction and control implementation as a metric of success. While Galvanize is using their software to reduce risk and implement control, they are also using their software to contribute to a reduction in expenditure and provide a quick return on investment to customers. In 2019, HighBond was positively impacting 77% of the fortune 500 companies and as of March 9th, 2020 Galvanize was named the leader of the GRC domain by Forrester Wave.

# Recommendations 
My recommendation to Galvanize would be to offer a package that tailors more towards smaller organizations. Many of the products offered by Galvanize seem to cater to larger organizations and might not offer the same benefits to a smaller organization. While I understand targeting larger organizations, I think that creating a platform specific to smaller organizations, Galvanize might be able to help them scale and have a better understanding of their business. I think offering a smaller comprehensive platform would benefit Galvanize by providing them with a new type of clientele. This could potentially lead to Galvanize offering data analytics on how to improve and grow small businesses.  I don’t think Galvanize would need to use any new technologies to offer this service however, they might benefit from adding a few partners to their association network to provide more insightful information to their clients. I think the technologies that Galvanize currently employs would allow them to offer a smaller platform because we are not adding to the platform but instead adjusting it to the needs of a smaller organization.
